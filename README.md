# AMLC 2020: Dive into Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

<h4>Time: TBA<br/>Location: Virtual Conference</h4>

Abstract
--------
Text is everywhere. Designing models to process and understand text, or 
Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
is a rapidly evolving area in artificial intelligence. Despite advancing at an incredible speed, 
it is still not trivial for practitioners to  apply state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT and ALBERT to 
their own text data. The reason is that the modern NLP techniques involve advancements in many different 
aspects, ranging from the low-level text preprocessing to the high-level modeling. 
In this introductory and hands-on tutorial, we will 
take a systematic look at these recent advancements and see how to solve real-world NLP problems from 
scratch with [GluonNLP](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp). GluonNLP is a powerful NLP toolkit that 
offers a numpy-like programming interface based on [Apache MXNet (incubating)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet). 
It adopts the easy-to-use Gluon front-end for building deep learning models, and provides utilities 
tailored for NLP practitioners.
